# MediaHub-Microfrontends
This project aims at builduing a hub that collects news feed from multiple social media platforms in one place. For the sake of demonstrating, project consists of multiple microfrontends for each social media, that is implemented using different framework. On the backend, microservices architecture will be used

Similarly to microservices, the microfrontends will allow to break monolithic frontend into smaller pieces. This, in its' turn will allow for independent development, but mainly it will allow for different tech stack to be used by each team. Therefore, the final product may consist of various component where each of the components is written in framework preffered by the programmer. All other features like flexibility, scalability, isolation are included.
